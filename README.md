## üöÄ Overview

An AI-powered scanner for Pump.fun tokens on Solana with advanced rugpull detection, pump probability analysis, and real-time monitoring. Based on research showing that **98.6% of Pump.fun tokens fail** and **93% show manipulation signs**, this scanner helps identify the rare legitimate opportunities.

## üìä Key Statistics
- Only **1.21%** of Pump.fun tokens reach DEX listing threshold
- **98%** of tokens show signs of manipulation
- **93%** of Raydium pools exhibit soft rug pull characteristics
- Bonding curve completion requires ~$68,000-$73,000 market cap

## üéØ Features

### Core Analysis
- **AI-Powered Pump Score**: Machine learning model that adapts based on outcomes
- **Rugpull Detection**: Multi-factor analysis including:
  - Liquidity lock status
  - Developer holdings analysis
  - Bundle wallet detection
  - Holder distribution patterns
  - Token age and creation patterns

### Real-Time Monitoring
- DexScreener integration for live data
- Bonding curve progress tracking
- Migration to Raydium detection
- Volume spike alerts
- Support/Resistance level calculation

### Risk Assessment
- 4-tier risk classification (Safe, Medium, High, Rugpull)
- Rugpull probability calculation
- Bundle detection algorithm
- Honeypot risk analysis

### Smart Features
- Learning from trading outcomes
- Pattern recognition database
- Similar token performance analysis
- Automated recommendations (BUY/SELL/WAIT)

## üîß Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository

```

## üìä Understanding the Scores

### Pump Score (0-100)
- **70-100**: Strong buy signal
- **50-70**: Monitor closely
- **30-50**: Caution advised
- **0-30**: Avoid/Sell signal

### Risk Levels

- Volume spike detection

### 4. AI Pattern Recognition
- Historical performance correlation
- Similar token analysis
- Creator pattern tracking
- Market timing analysis

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Warnings

1. **High Failure Rate**: 98.6% of Pump.fun tokens fail to complete bonding curve
2. **Manipulation Risk**: 93% of pools show manipulation characteristics
3. **Fast Market**: Tokens can pump and dump within minutes
4. **Bundle Risk**: Many tokens use bundled wallets to fake activity

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- Automatic rugpull detection
- Bundle wallet identification
- Suspicious name filtering
- Age-based risk assessment
- Liquidity verification

## üìà Bonding Curve Mechanics

- Initial supply: 1 billion tokens
- 793 million allocated to bonding curve
- Completion at ~$68,000-$73,000 market cap
- Requires 85 SOL collected
- Automatic migration to Raydium/PumpSwap

## üîß Configuration

Edit `config.py` to customize:
```python
class Config:
    # Risk thresholds
    MIN_LIQUIDITY = 5000  # USD
    MAX_DEV_HOLDING = 15  # Percentage
    MIN_HOLDERS = 100
    
    # Trading parameters
    DEFAULT_BUY_AMOUNT = 0.1  # SOL
    SLIPPAGE = 10  # Percentage
    
    # AI weights (auto-adjusted)
    INITIAL_WEIGHTS = {
        'liquidity': 0.15,
        'holders_distribution': 0.20,
        'volume_trend': 0.15,
        'dev_holding': -0.25,
        'bundle_penalty': -0.30
    }
```
